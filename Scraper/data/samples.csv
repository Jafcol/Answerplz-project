travel/accepted/is amsteel blue appropriate for a use as a runner???/ amsteel blue is a dyneema cord that size for size is just as strong as steel cable. it ll hold. in terms of abrasion resistance, dyneema happens to be superior to nylon rope when it comes to wear and tear. there are two factors to consider when using dyneema it has a lower melting point than nylon and, it doesn t hold knots as well. you re going to have to learn new knots to tie that will hold in dyneema cord. it would work well enough as a throw away rap anchor if you can learn how to tie it, but i wouldn t suggest investing in it specifically for climbing. /null

travel/accepted/should i wash new child snow mittens before wearing???/ following csk advice, i washed the mittens in luke warm water with a little bit of soap and then dried on a rack. i was worried that washing might remove the waterproofing but that was silly the mittens were soaked through on the first day of actual use and on all the days after that. so even if i had not washed them prior to use, they would have become soaked on the first day anyway . but they did keep dry for a while each day, and performed better that older gloves. /null

travel/accepted/how should i cast to a trout lying in the tail of the pool???/ use the fast moving water as cover, approach from downstream and present your fly holding the rod high and keeping as much line away from the water as possible. remember that in most cases the fish is facing upstream when feeding, so you can get close enough to drop the fly a few feet ahead of it if you keep a low profile yourself. this situation is where a longer rod with a longer leader or very light fly line helps you. think tenkara or european style nymphing. /null
travel/accepted/what is this long brownish bug ???/ found it almost certainly the poplar borer beetle . distinguishing characteristics are the golden yellow spots under the black speckles. borers all have that shape to the head and thorax. longhorn indicates the long antennae. these are quite a destructive pest of poplar and a few other species in much of north america. note i am not an entomologist of any sort, or even from north america just good at googling things. /null

travel/accepted/what factors are important to consider when purchasing a bow trigger release system???/ as other aspects of archery, there is no rule of the thumb to choose release aids. i don t use trigger release but a back tension one. if we compare all types of release aids, you would have a few different options to try and choose from but narrowing down to thumb trigger releases, i d say the best you can do is to try a few different ones from friends that use them. archery shops could also have a few to try. personally, i d go for the cheapest to start. /null

scifi/accepted/could an all knowing being create electricity in the year 2e ad???/ baghdad battery earliest known appearance was 15e ad, which is a tiny 1ee year gap from your target. in an odd sort of way, religion was actually a big patron of science early on. they relied on marvels they could pass off as divine miracles in order to bolster devotion to their faith. this is one such theory to the origin of the battery however its true purpose has yet been found. regardless they had a battery which i feel trumps franklin s kite. /null
scifi/accepted/what happens to the human body when hit by a magic lightning and a frozen arrow at the same time???/ it was a bad idea. the cryomancer is used to cold stuff, but electricity is new to her. the extreme coldness and consequent superconductivity increases the charge on the arrow. as the arrow approaches its target, the charge causes it to be repelled so that it slows in the air. it comes to a stop about a foot from the target and then gently drifts down. the target reaches out in curiosity and grabs at the arrow but it moves away, still repelled. the cryomancer snorts in disgust. her archer friend rolls his eyes. /null
scifi/accepted/what would a sea made of iodine look like???/ according to this paper , iodine can be melted under relatively controlled conditions. iodine is classically described as a sublimating solid . the accompanying video shows very clearly that solid iodine crystals can be melted into a very dark inky purpley black liquid. melting iodine so i guess the answer is if you have a sufficiently stable temperature within the planet, an ocean of iodine will look like very dark, deep, deep purple black ink and it will smell like iodine. mediciney . /youtube.com
scifi/unaccepted/how to maintain container temperature for as long as possible???/ weave a mesh basket like a tea infuser out of channelium with a long chain or wire handle. put the stone inside the channelium basket. use the handle to lower and raise the stone into and out of whatever container you are using. the mesh allows for circulation of liquid around the stone, and keeps the stone in place, so long as you remove it before it shrinks to the point it s smaller than the weave of the mesh, while also allowing constant contact with the channelium. and it ll work with any container made from whatever material you happen to have handy. /null
scifi/accepted/how would gravity affect a torus shaped planet???/ it can t exist and it can t support life. such a thing would have to be constructed in space. it would not produce any gravity unless it was spinning, and then only on the inside. with just rock holding it together, it would quickly fly apart and break up into asteroids floating in space. then, over a few million years, they would crash back into each other and begin to form a proper planet. for any of this to work, you would need magic, or it would have to be artificial. /null
scifi/unaccepted/how would you build a realistic le palm d orbit???/ here would be my approach grey outside landing docks for spaceships, don t rotate orange restaurant, rotating, centrifugal forces lead to gravity blue zero g facilities but of course, as stephan already mentioned, this would require our palm to rotate sideways around earth , so you would have to simulate the nice view to the earth by using displays or, as stephan proposed mirrors. /null
scifi/accepted/could a future, science fiction submarine navigate almost vertical and or turn upside down???/ according to your edit, probably it is not necessary to develop a complete submarine . the submarine could approach the intelligent creatures and then release an unmanned, remote or wire controlled submarine drone to communicate. for instance, the drone could use this technology under development at mit. the reason for having such a drone on board is that it is a standard equipment, to be used for either scientific or recreational use /null
scifi/unaccepted/is is plausible for an earth like planet to have all of its land located in one polar hemisphere???/ yes, and earth already did it. here s earth in the late cambrian. the majority of the landmass isn t centered on the south pole, but offset a bit. there s no particular reason it could have just as easily been centered on it. /null
scifi/unaccepted/can multiple similar planets share the same orbit without interfering with each other too much???/ what you re describing is called a klemperer rosette . there is much information about this configuration across the interwebs, and even on this very site . /null
scifi/accepted/how could somersaulting worms evolve???/ wedge from above. they grow thick, colonies of these worms. shoulder to shoulder. there is no space for a worm to get past its sister worms moving horizontally. too many worms in the way. when a worm wants to move, it has one option up. it clears the top of the worm colony. then as it descends it makes its leading edge a point and wedges its way back into the colony. this mode would also work if the worms lived in tightly spaced forests, like bamboo forests. /null
scifi/accepted/is it possible to grow new organs through exposure to radioactivity???/ considering that you said feel free to suggest alternative or solution to grow new organs like mutant or through eating other stuff radiation is probably not the way to go for the results you want. the growth of new organs requires modification of dna, recently there have been lots of advancements in dna editing through crispr . maybe the plant they are consuming produces a crispr like gene editing process at random and that allows for mutations. nevertheless gene editing is not my area of expertise, but for a layman it may sound plausible enough that it will fit your story. /null
scifi/accepted/is there a reason that females passing on more than 1 2 of their genetics to the child would be unlikely to evolve???/ in regards as to why this may not work for other species one problem is that males and females will need vastly different meiosis processes. in humans, egg and sperm cells are obviously different, but the processes that format the dna for those gametes are pretty similar. how does this evolve? how does the first female whose gametes have 2 3 of a full dna complement find a male with 1 3 of a full dna compliment? it seems exceedingly unlikely one female member of the species will have the right mutation at the same time and in the same vicinity as a male with the right mutation . /null
scifi/accepted/could a dystopian society control non perishable foods to prevent escape mutiny???/ yeasts and bacteria can be added to foods to make them spoil fairly quickly. fermentation would be my go to choice on this one. even wild honey will ferment when just a little water is added to it and raisins contain loads of wild yeast already. /null
scifi/accepted/neodymium magnets as nanoparticles bonded with atmospheric amide to create a magnetic air curtain ???/ no, even if the nano particles could retain their magnetic properties, what you would have done is released a bunch of particles that are free to orient themselves and connect with other particles. they would quickly collect into a mass and fall, raining out of the air. the further they had to fall, the larger they would become. /null
scifi/accepted/what would be some noticeable differences on tiny human beings???/ smaller vocal cords would make higher pitched voices. smaller cochlea would resonate to higher frequency sound. smaller eyes would require the eye lens to bend more to focus light in a shorter distance. smaller ratio of mass to lung surface area would mean they would hyperventilate if they didn t breathe much more slowly, which could make speech slower. in proportion to their weight, they d be able to lift more. in proportion to their height they could fall greater distances safely. /null
scifi/accepted/what is the scientific name for an intelligent species that can breed with all other known intelligent species???/ this is simple enough. pangenic or from the greek, roughly speaking, all producing or all making .possibly, even paneious or all egg or the capacity to breed, for example  share eggs with all species. whatever the latin equivalents are they will begin omni . /null
sports/accepted/who would win in a street fight ufc fight? prime mayweather or a taekwondo black belt???/i want to say taekwondo black belt, since boxing is so specific and limited as a fight sport. but there s also no ground game involved in either of them. i d still side with taekwondo just because they can use kicks. they could chop floyd down like a tree, kicking his legs./null
sports/accepted/can you kick the ball in water polo???/no. the ball won t stay submerged long enough to kick it./null

sports/accepted/what record in sports will nwver be broken? my pick is ricky hendersons career stolen bases.??/old mlb pitching records will never be touched, like cy young s career wins and complete games. the game has changed too much for those to ever be broken. /null
sports/accepted/injuries in football???/where do you live? because in the states, rugby is barely on tv so you wouldn t see as many injuries. rugby players, and aussie rules players, get royally fucked as well. rugby though is a slower game than other football codes so while they hit there isn t the full on launch and stick a guy type of contact like in the nfl. also, this is just my opinion, having no helmet makes it safer. you re much more aware of your head in the surroundings of the game and are looking to keep it out of trouble while a helmet can give a false sense of invincibility./null
sports/accepted/what is fascinating about sport and why do people like it that much???/sports are modern proxy for the instinctive human need to be in a tribe. instead of bloodletting on fields and sacrificing the fallen, we channel that primal need into football matches and hockey games. as is any case it can be extreme but it feels a need. nova sciencenow had a great show about sports and mirror neurons in the brain many years ago that you should look to find. as for me, sports allows me to connect with broader culture around the world and make me feel like i am part of something bigger than myself./null
sports/accepted/why do football teams to line their wide receivers so far from the center???/essentially to spread out the defense. imagine a run up the middle with all dbacks stacked up in front of the runner. /null
sports/accepted/ getting started with swimming, what do i need to know???/find a class. find a coach that can teach you the basics of how to swim. then, like any other skill, keep working at it. i am a competent swimmer because i have the ability to work at it and can keep sharp. once you truly know how to swim it s like riding a bike. you don t forget./null
sports/accepted/what s the point of running bases when hitting a home run???/i believe it s a mix of just because and to maintain run stats. however there have been walkoff home runs where the batter doesn t go all the way around because he gets mobbed by his teammates beforehand./null
sports/accepted/should i stick to soccer or what other sport should i do that i can get good at???/where do you live? there are low tier, semipro soccer leagues in the us like the npsl. most sports have leagues like that locally from semipro football to baseball. /null
sports/unaccepted/what do coaches or physical education teachers mean when they say stay square to the ball or the opponent???/squaring up really means making your body square. for example, . the idea is to keep your feet underneath you and to face your opponent, well, squarely. it keeps your center of gravity low and your weight balanced. the same goes for squaring up defensively for a tackle in football or a ground ball in baseball. by staying balanced in that way you can more easily move in any direction. if you get turned around, turned sideways in basketball for instance, /null
sports/accepted/what do americans think about canadian sport franchises in a heavily favoured american market? ??/i am in michigan and somewhat familiar with canada so i can t speak for others, but i see them no differently than any of the american teams. i was pretty young when the grizzlies left vancouver but i remember the expos leaving for dc. it was really no different than seeing the raiders move to las vegas/null

sports/accepted/why did ronaldhino go from close to best player in the world to very average???/most players hit their peak around age 27. http bbc.com news magazine 28254123 then they start to decline, defensive players and keepers decline slower, and player who are exceptional because of their raw speed and athleticism begin to decline faster./null
sports/accepted/ could the best college team beat the worst professional team???/i think it s possible to maybe get 4e if they play every game at ncaa rules. the difference in rules between college bball and the nba are huge. no continuation rules, no defensive three seconds, and consistent travelling calls may just be enough for the college players to push the pros out of their comfort zone and pull it off./null
sports/accepted/what do leagues do with the money collected from fining players and coaches, la mike tomlin s sideline incident???/donated to charity/null
mythology/accepted/how does the mighty man of magic atone for his plague???/ the answer is in the quote all the losses that ever i have caused thee, said he, i will make thee atonement for, equal to what i have taken . and i will never do the like from this time forth. but thy faithful vassal will i be . and the king accepted this from him. presumably, the atonement consists of this man giving lludd the food back , and of becoming lludd s vassal. the magician isn t mentioned anywhere else in the welsh cannon, so this is as much information as you are going to get. /null

mythology/accepted/are there any females who have many consorts but are still celebrated???/ artemis famously had consorts consorts of artemis actaeon lamar ronald lacey s the myth of aktaion literary and iconographic studies, the most likely original version of the myth is that actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess. hippolytus a devotee of artemis who vowed to pursue a chaste life as a hunter and was undone by aphrodite in revenge. orion a favorite companion of artemis, who was also undone. callisto the most famous of artemis female companions. artemis was definitely celebrated, and cannot be claimed to be lustful. /null

mythology/accepted/does loki grow old and infirm while chained beneath the serpent???/ in the poetic edda, it s clear that loki is different from the aesir. he descended from ymir, whereas the aesir did not. it s possible that his rules are different from the aesir s, too. for example, he shape shifted into the female gender on several different occasions whereas, the aesir were never known to do that. it seemed likely that he went for several years without eating an apple and he couldn t care less. /null
mythology/accepted/is there an english translation of the inuit story mother of the dog children ???/ the text on that page seems to come from this collection of stories. the text is attributed to a neil christopher. the year at the end of the text also appears in the references page at the end of the collection. i believe the reference is to the collected notes on inuits by george comer, james s. mutch, and e.j. peck. on pages 165 and 327 there are two versions of the story. /null
mythology/accepted/why did pittheus trick aegeus???/ a grandson. since his purpose was to get him to sleep with his daughter, he must have deduced that the resulting son would be something special, and special enough to risk angering aegeus. at least, on the face of it. there are no myths that go into what he was thinking. /null
mythology/accepted/was nuada airgetl accompanied by dogs???/ as far as my studies have found what you have found is all there is. the association is strictly based on the common understanding that nuada is the post christian irish descendent of the celtic god nodens. lugh and c chulainn are the figures that are most associated with dogs in irish myth. their rise in prominence and might explain the lack of association with nuada. /null
mythology/accepted/what is the differences between the two versions of these myths???/ really, none. both paintings show that zeus led europa away in the form of a bull. the only difference i can make between those paintings are the fact that the first one is only europa is the only one, while the second, she is with her friends, being misled by zeus. /null
mythology/accepted/are there any stories which are about a species that is neither human nor divine???/ you mention nymphs, so i ll direct you to daphne , who is the heroine of her story . it may start with apollo, but he is distinctly the antagonist, thus, while the story involves him, it is about her. i am also going to propose john gardner s grendel , which may not be strictly canonical, but is certainly worthwhile and a part of the overall beowulf body of literature. /en.wikisource.org,en.wikipedia.org

movies/accepted/about "naruto", about character, if jiraiya is so rich, why does he keep taking "naruto" s money???/ well jiraiya is a legendary sannin alright but there is no explanation given by masashi kishimoto in the manga as far as i could remember relating to that attribute. given the fact he is clumsy, show off , an open pervert .and most importantly he is "naruto" s godfather i think he would have wanted for "naruto" to work for the ninjutsu he teaches him . kishi himself said that the best teacher student bonding he loved writing was with jiraiya and "naruto" and jiraiya s cheap tricks when it comes to money seems to me is more of messing with "naruto" in a playful sense more than anything. /null

cooking/accepted/choosing grind size should be considered for older coffee beans???/ the reason this is suggested is because beans essentially lose flavor over time. they go stale and their oils go rancid. grinding finer exposes more surface area of the bean to the brew and helps you eke out a bit more flavor when the bean is old and stale. however, doing this for pour over can backfire as pour over is highly sensitive to grind. too fine and your pour over won t drain the filter will clog. try it first with your normal grind, and if that s no good, dial it one or two clicks finer. much past that and you re in no go territory for the brew method most likely. /null

cooking/accepted/is diluting filter concentrate after the brew the same as brewing with the additional water???/ no it is not the same. the brew ratio is important to extract the right amount of solubles from the coffee, ideally all the pleasant ones and only few of the unpleasant ones. if you brew with less water, you ll dissolve less of the coffee s goodness, and diluting that will lead to a thin coffee compared to a correctly brewed one. conversely, if you brew with too much water, you ll extract bitter substances you won t like, so if you like a thinner coffe it s best to brew normally and then dilute. unfortunately, the aeropress is not really suitable to serve multiple guests. /null
cooking/accepted/eureka mignon grinders and dosing cups???/ yes they do, provided you remove the portafilter holder and don t put dosing cup too far away from the hole, it is only as wide as a portafilter after all so there could be some spilt grounds if it s not close enough. i found a small wooden brick that fits in front of the mignon and has the perfect height for my dosing cup. i just coloured it black and now it looks as if it s a part of the grinder. /null
